Proxy --> client's imposter (server will think proxy is the actual client)

Entities involved :-
1. Subject Interface
2. RealSubject, Proxy both of which implement Subject

3. Instead of RealSubject.fn() use Proxy.fn()
4. Proxy.fn() should call RealSubject.fn() and have some additional logic around it


used when?
1) caching
2) for blacklisting certain requests (access restriction)
3) pre processing and post processing (logging, publish event)
4) marshalling and unmarshalling (serialize and deserialize requests and responses)
5) lazy loading/initialisation 

public class LazyInitializedObject {
    private Object heavyObject; // Declared but not initialized

    public Object getHeavyObject() {
        if (heavyObject == null) { // Check if the object is already created
            heavyObject = new Object(); // Initialize only when needed
        }
        return heavyObject;
    }
}
