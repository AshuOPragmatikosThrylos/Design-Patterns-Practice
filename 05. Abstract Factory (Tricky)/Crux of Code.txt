Entities involved :-
1. FactoryInterface
    -- contains functions like
           Object createObject1();
           Object createObject2();

    -- Note: it is not interface of interfaces (not FactoryOfFactory) instead directly create object of the lowest level
2. Factory1, Factory2 classes which implement FactoryInterface
3. Object1, Object2 classes which implement ObjectInterface
4. AbstractFactory class - has conditional logic to create factory, object depending on factoryType, objectType entered by user 


If multiple types or implementations (Object1, Object2, Factory1, Factory 2) exist for a certain concept, we need an interface (ObjectInterface, factoryInterface) to demonstrate the connection between these types
