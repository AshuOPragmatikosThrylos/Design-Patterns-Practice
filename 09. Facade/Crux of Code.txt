facade == abstraction wrapper

used when:
1. expose limited system functions to client
2. combine functions into one for the client
3. merge facades into one for the client

Difference between Facade and Adapter

Difference between Facade and Proxy
 1. Facade simplifies interaction with a subsystem; Proxy controls access to an object
 2. Facade doesnâ€™t manage access; Proxy adds behavior
