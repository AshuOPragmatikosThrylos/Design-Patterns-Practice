used when have to prevent NPE without having to use not-null checks everywhere
instead of returning null, it returns a special Null Object that represents a "do-nothing" or "default behavior"

Cons:
1. memory overhead
2. default implementation might hide bugs if logging or behavior is accidentally omitted
