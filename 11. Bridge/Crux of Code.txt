abstract class has
1) an interface objectReference
2) and a constructor for thar object Reference
3 and an abstract method of course

But why?
so that 
1) abstract class can have N number of subclass
and 2) the interface can have n number of implementations
3) and subclasses and implementations are not tightly coupled and each can grow in number independently


how is bridge different from strategy
- it's practically the same
- except that in strategy we don't expect class which has interface objectReference to be inherited by n number of subclasses

Example
1) video - youtube video,prime video, netflix video
2) resolution - 360p, 480p, HD, 4K
Both can grow independently
